Initialization:

1. When we have function init and not a constructor, we may init it multiple times or even work with uninitialized protocol.
   We must check if the protocol is initialize and initialize it if needed

2. If the contract is upgradeable, we must init the contract that is inherited (probably from openzepelin) and include its functions to the contract (the ones that must be overriden)
