Inflation attack:


The problem with this attack is that it is vulnarable to sandwich attacks


1. uses balanceOf
2. rounding down/ presicion loss => uses / => check with really small amount (1wei) and really big amount 1 or 10 or 100 eth
   => we have to make the a/b so that b is bigger than a so it rounds down to 0 
   => check arithmetic attack to see website that calcukates such divisions
3. has first depositor logic => for example if(supply==0)return 1 ether;


if we have all 3 of these there is probably inflation attack:

if we have a vault

bonus:

Liquidation

may revert if:
transfer 0 amount
the person is blacklisted


must check fees when we transfer and then calculate, update and gets the fees and sees if the person can pay them
check if there is enough money to borrow - when a position becomes insolvent
check if the position is healthy => not liquidatable, not insolvent
