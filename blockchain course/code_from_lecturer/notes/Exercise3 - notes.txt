Exercise3 - notes 20.03

Mapping:
	keys can only be primitive data types which are hashed and transformed to address
 
 
calldata is used for input params

one transaction has a lot of metadata (not only sender/receiver). The metadata is accessible through msg (object) keyword. So msg.value is the amount of the crypto sent.
the value is always in WEI

if we send crypto and data but the fallback isn't payable we get an error and revert 

we can access smth outside of the network with specific SC called Oracle (it is a big security thread)

always when we refer to a SC we call it throuhh its address 
all function and fields "live" on that address
in order to communicate with a SC we should know its address

account ~ address (account is a bit more abstract)
