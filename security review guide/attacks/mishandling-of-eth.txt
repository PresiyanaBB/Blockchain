[H/M]

Mishandling of eth:

1. If our contract depends on its onw ballance (if ballance == x) , then attacker may send eth via selfdestruct() and cause DoS
   -> Mitigations: use >= and not ==

2. If we send eth to multiple users in one tx, attacker may have revert() in his receive()/fallback() causing DoS
    -> Mitigations: send eth to only 1 user per tx
