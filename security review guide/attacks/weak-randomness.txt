Weak randomness / pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) - when we we use weak random generating method or one that can be controlled by miners or nodes


1. Do NOT use: 
   -> block.timestamp
   -> blockhash
   -> block.number
   -> block.difficulty
   -> block.prevrandao
   -> address(addr).balance
   -> address / msg.sender    

basically we should avoid everything that can be manipulated
