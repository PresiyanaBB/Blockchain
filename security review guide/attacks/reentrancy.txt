Reentrancy - when the transfer of money is before the update of the state, thus a hacker can call the same function in its receive() and will always get the money and will spam calls because the state isn't updated yet


1. Every time we tranfer money and update the state of some variables, make sure to FIRST UPDATE , THEN TRANSFER the money


CEI rule to prevent reentrancy:
1. Checks/requires
2. Effect/change state/change vars/make impact
3. Interact/send money/transfer/call
