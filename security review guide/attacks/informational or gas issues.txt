Cas/Informational:

1. Check if comments above functions are correct it temrs of params, notes and so on

2. Use of different versions of pragma solidity

3. ++i >>> i++

4. if we have a loop and in it we have arr.length , we should cache it outside the loop in some variable so it doesn't do so many storage calls

5. if there is any storage vatioable that is constant/immutable , we should put the corresponding keyword so that we waste less gas
